# ChromPolymerDB_tutorial

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
The spatial organization of the genome plays a fundamental role in gene regulation, replication, and other biological processes. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) techniques have advanced our understanding of genome architecture, but they primarily produce 2D, population-averaged data, limiting insights into individual cell chromatin structures. To bridge this gap, this project introduces a computational method and web-based platform designed for high-resolution visualization and analysis of single-cell 3D chromatin conformations.
